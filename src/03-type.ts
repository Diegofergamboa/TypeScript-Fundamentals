// We can use the flexibility of the flexible type and use the declaration of the type. For example in the next variable we made the normal declaration, but at the same type we declare what kind of variable type it is

const myNumber : number = 20
const myString : string = 'Diego'

//* Indeference of the type

// JavaScript assign a reader of type but let the compiler save the type of variables

let myProductName = 'Product 1'
// Adding a "." at the end of the variables I can check what kindof type of variable we have
myProductName.toLocaleLowerCase()

// In the const we donÂ´t let that the variable can be rewritable
const anotherName = 'Another string with a const'
